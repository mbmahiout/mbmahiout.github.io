# About
As an analyst in the actuarial function of an insurance company, my day-to-day work consists of coding, statistics, and data analysis.
My academic interests are centered around statistics, machine learning and neuroscience. For the past few years I've also had a growing interest in actuarial science and quantitative finance.
